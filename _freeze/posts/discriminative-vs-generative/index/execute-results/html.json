has been written about their differences, though not always as clearly as one would hope.\nFollowing @lasserre2006principled and @minka2005discriminative, we will show how they can be seen to be at different ends of a spectrum, and then discuss some of their differences in detail.\n\nWe will work through the definitions and differences by considering _probabilistic (graphical) models_, specifically using the _factor graph_ representation[^1].\nThroughout, we will focus on _classification_, where we are given a labelled data set $D = \\lbrace \\left( x^i, y^i \\right) \\rbrace_N$ with inputs $x^i = \\left( x^i_1, \\cdots, x^i_n \\right)$ and labels $y^i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$, and we want $P \\left( y = 1 \\vert x = \\hat x, D \\right)$ for some (new) $\\hat x$[^2].\nThe definitions and the generative-discriminative dichotomy are however more general, i.e. they are not restricted to the problem of classification.\n\n[^1]: Factor graphs are a more detailed representation of a probabilistic graphical model that specifies the factorization of the joint probability being modelled.\nSee e.g. @loeliger2004introduction.\n\n[^2]: Note that actually determining which class to assign to $\\hat x$ requires a final decision. \nWe will ignore this as well as _discriminant functions_, which combine the inference and the decision steps.\nSee [@bishop2006pattern, Section 1.5.4] for a discussion.\n\n## Generative models can be used to generate synthetic data\n\nA _discriminative model_ is one that provides $P \\left( y \\vert x \\right)$ directly.\nThe name comes from the fact that we can view the distribution (together with the decision to choose the most probable value) as directly discriminating the value of the target $y$ for any given instance $x$.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n![Discriminative model, as used for prediction.](index_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMirorring the definition of a discriminative model, a _generative model_ is instead often defined as one that provides the joint probability $P \\left( x, y \\right)$ in the form $P \\left( x \\vert y \\right)P \\left( y \\right)$, on which one can then use Bayes' theorem to obtain $P \\left( y \\vert x \\right) \\propto P \\left( x \\vert y \\right)P \\left( y \\right).$ \nThe graph representation for such a model is shown below.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n![Generative model with \"default\" factorization, as used for prediction.](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA good reference on classification, which introduces and compares these approaches, is @bishop2006pattern [Chapter 4].\n\nThe more general definition is that a generative model is one that can generate data via _ancestral sampling_, i.e. sampling from the priors and passing the sampled values through the graphical model.\nThis includes the definition above, which also has a choice of factorisation.\nWe can also turn our discriminative model into a generative one by adding a factor for $P \\left( x \\right)$, such that it too models the joint distribution $P \\left( x, y \\right)$. \nPut differently, the factorization used in the definition of the generative model above is not what makes it a generative model. \nIt is rather the fact that it models the joint distribution.\nIn order to distinguish between the (first) generative model and the extended discriminative model, which is also a generative model, Mitchell refers to the former as a _Bayes classifier_ given that it uses Bayes theorem to recover $P \\left( y \\vert x \\right)$ [@mitchell2020generative].\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n![Extended discriminative model with prior for $x$, as used for prediction.](index_files/figure-html/fg-discr-extended-output-1.svg){#fg-discr-extended}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that we sometimes also find people stating that generative models are ones that capture the causal process by which the actual data ($D$) is generated. \nWhile it is true that one might build a generative model by thinking about the causal process, it could be that the causal _data generation process_ requires $P \\left( y \\vert x \\right)$ rather than $P \\left( x \\vert y \\right)$. \nWe therefore distinguish between generative models and generative processes.\n\n## Generative models consider a more restictive parameter space\n\nLet's now look at the fundamental difference between the two model types by considering them in all generality and focusing on their parametrisation as done by @minka2005discriminative.\n\nWe write the generative model, with parameters, as\n\n$$\nP_1 \\left( x, y \\vert \\theta \\right) = P_{11} \\left( x \\vert y, \\theta \\right) P_{12} \\left( y \\vert \\theta \\right).\n$$\n\nWe can train the model, i.e. perform inference, to obtain the posterior probability $P \\left( \\theta \\vert D \\right)$ by considering the joint distribution\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP_g \\left( D, \\theta \\right)    &= P_{01} \\left( \\theta \\right) P \\left( D \\vert \\theta \\right) \\\\\n                                &= P_{01} \\left( \\theta \\right) \\prod_i P_1 \\left( x_i, y_i \\vert \\theta \\right) \\\\\n                                &= P_{01} \\left( \\theta \\right) \\prod_i P_{11} \\left( x_i \\vert y_i, \\theta \\right) P_{12} \\left( y_i \\vert \\theta \\right),\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere we have used the iid assumption on the data.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display

find $\\hat \\theta$. \nThe BIASlab couse nicely explains the different approaches with examples [@devries2021bmlip].\n\nLet's now write the discriminative model, with parameters, as $P_{21} \\left( y \\vert x, \\theta \\right)$. \nIn order to compare it with the generative model, we extend the discriminative model by adding a probability over $x$ and a second parameter in order to obtain the joint distribution\n\n$$\nP_2 \\left( x, y \\vert \\theta, \\phi \\right) = P_{21} \\left( y \\vert x, \\theta \\right) P_{22} \\left( x \\vert \\phi \\right),\n$$\n\nbut consider the same joint

Considering a joint $P \\left( \\theta, \\phi \\right)$ allows us to work with \"hybrid\" models.\n\n## Generative models require more assumptions\n\nWe have just shown that the generative model can be seen as considering a reduced parameter space. \nFurthermore, compared with the discriminative disctribution $P_{21} \\left( y \\vert x , \\theta \\right)$, the joint distribution considered by the generative model is often hard to work with in practice and further simplifying assumptions are often necessary, or preferable, in order to make inference tractable.\n\nTo understand why generative models require more modelling assumptions, we will consider the case of Boolean inputs $x = \\left( x_1, \\cdots, x_n \\right)$, $x_j \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$.\n\nIt can be instructive to update the factor graphs and draw some of the individual components of the input.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n![Discriminative model with two components of the input vector drawn.](index_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=11}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n![Generative model with two components of the input vector drawn.](index_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet us now look at the parameters necessary for the generative model by first considering the conditional probability table for $P\\left( x \\vert y \\right)$ with $x$ represented as a single vector.\n\n|                      |                 |                   |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n|                      | $y = 0$         | $y = 1$           |\n| $x = (0, \\cdots, 0)$ | $\\theta^0_{1}$  | $\\theta^1_{1}$    |\n| $x = (1, \\cdots, 0)$ | $\\theta^0_{2}$  | $\\theta^1_{2}$    |\n| $\\cdots$             | $\\cdots$        | $\\cdots$          |\n| $x = (1, \\cdots, 1)$ | $\\theta^0_{2^n}$ | $\\theta^1_{2^n}$   |\n\nWe see that we have $2 \\times 2^n = 2^{n + 1}$ parameters. \nThe (conditional) probability constraints (on the columns) bring this count down to $2 \\left( 2^n - 1\\right)$.\n\nThe other factor in the generative model, $P \\left( y \\right)$, is not an issue, as we only have one effective parameter given $y$ is a Boolean variable.\n\nFor the discriminative model, we instead have to consider $P \\left( y \\vert x \\right)$.\nHere the conditional probability table is flipped.\n\n|         |                      |          |                      |\n|---------|----------------------|----------|----------------------|\n|         | $x = (0, \\cdots, 0)$ | $\\cdots$ | $x = (1, \\cdots, 1)$ |\n| $y = 0$ | $\\theta^0_{1}$       | $\\cdots$ | $\\theta^0_{2^n}$      |\n| $y = 1$ | $\\theta^1_{1}$       | $\\cdots$ | $\\theta^1_{2^n}$      |\n\nSimply flipping the conditionality, and again using the conditional probability constraints, leads to $2^n$ effective parameters. \nThis is less parameters than those for the generative model. \nFor large $n$, essentially half as many.\n\nWhat is often done in generative models is to add further simplifying assumptions.\nIn the Naive Bayes classifier for example, we assume each $x_i$ is conditionally independent of all other $x_{-i}$ given $y$.\nTogether with the product rule, this gives\n\n$$\nP \\left(x \\vert y \\right) = \\prod_i P \\left( x_i \\vert y \\right).\n$$\n\n\nWe can visualise this more granular factorization of the conditional probability by drawing the factor graph. \nThis time using plate notation.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=11}\n![Generative model with Naive Bayes assumption.](index_files/figure-html/cell-13-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, each $x_i$ has its own conditional probability table, which is simply\n\n|           |                 |                   |\n|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|\n|           | $y = 0$         | $y = 1$           |\n| $x_i = 0$ | $\\theta^0_{0}$  | $\\theta^1_{0}$    |\n| $x_i = 1$ | $\\theta^0_{1}$  | $\\theta^1_{1}$    |\n\nand the conditional probability constraints bring the number of parameters per input variable from four to two. \nThus, overall we have $2 n$ parameters to estimate.\nThis is now less than the $2^n$ of the discriminative model (provided $n > 2$).\n\nOn top of the number of parameters that need to be estimated, in order to reliably estimate them, we need to observe each distinct instance multiple times.\nThis is discussed in [@mitchell2020generative].\n\nWe thus can, and often do, introduce futher bias in generative models in order to make them tractable.\nA consequence of this is that generative models can be less accurate, if they (i.e. the small world model) don't reflect the large world model[^3], but (when they do) generative models require less data to train.\n\n[^3]: This is Savage's [terminology](https://errorstatistics.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/savage-forum-combined-searchable_red.pdf), as presented by McElreath in Statistical Rethinking: _\"All statisitcal modelling has these two frames: the small world of the model itself and the large world we hope to deploy the model in.\"_ [@mcelreath2020statistical, page 19].\n\n## Generative models can deal with missing data\n\nLet's turn to the often mentioned fact that generative models can deal with missing data.\nWhat this means is that they can still make predictions if given a vector of inputs $\\hat x = \\left( \\hat x_1, \\cdots, \\hat x_k, \\bar x_{k+1}, \\cdots, \\bar x_n \\right) = \\left( \\hat x_o, \\bar x_m \\right)$, where $\\bar x_m$ are missing, whereas discriminative models can't.\n\nWhen it comes to predicting $\\hat y$ given $\\hat x$ (and $D$), we need the posterior predictive distribution, namely\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP \\left( \\hat y \\vert \\hat x, D \\right) &= \\int_\\Theta P \\left( \\hat y, \\theta \\vert \\hat x, D \\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\\\\n                                        &= \\int_\\Theta P \\left( \\hat y \\vert \\hat x, \\theta \\right) P \\left( \\theta \\vert D \\right) \\mathrm{d} \\theta,\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere we assume that the past and future observations are conditionally independent given $\\theta$.\n\nIn the case of missing inputs, we want to consider\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP \\left( \\hat y \\vert \\hat x_o, \\theta \\right)  &= \\sum_{\\bar x_m} P \\left( \\hat y, \\bar x_m \\vert \\hat x_o, \\theta \\right) \\\\\n                                                &= \\sum_{\\bar x_m} P \\left( \\hat y \\vert \\hat x_o, \\bar x_m , \\theta \\right) P \\left( \\bar x_m \\vert \\hat x_o, \\theta \\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nand plug this into the posterior predictive distribution.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n![Discriminative model being used for prediction, with missing inputs $\\bar x_m$.
